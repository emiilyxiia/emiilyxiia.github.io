# :rose: My official portfolio website in-development

This project was created in my endeavor to learn Javascript, HTML, and CSS. Current pushes are pushed into developing. 


### Current Progress
- [X] Navigation Bar (resizes with screen, hoverable items)
- [X] Interactive menu for screens < 960px (it is interactive but behaves strangely on edge case monitor sizes)
- [X] Moving Portrait when hovered
- [ ] Projects / Art webpage (created but needs to be updated)
- [ ] See Jan 16 Button Plan
- [ ] See Jan 17 website design plan
- [ ] Streamline code

### :book: Documenting my journey
- (Jan 17, 2023) Testing on varying monitor sizes reveals bugs in website design. Design works well for desktop + mac screen resizes and mobile however. I need to learn more about responsive website design to fix these issues. Plan: try rewriting parts of code using grid/flex layout. If it requires too many fixes, learn Springboot's framework to aid in responsive design.

- (Jan 16, 2023) I tried to create a "Say hi" button that would increment by 1 when clicked, and would tell the user how many users said hi. However, after trying with Javascript, HTML/CSS, I realized such a feat was impossible across multiple users without a database or storage. The counts disappear when the page is refreshed, and I also need to code it so the user can only click the button once. Plan: come back to this project after learning how databases function (mySQL?) and can be used to code the "Say hi!" button. If I can code this button, I can delve further into these topics by creating a quiz for visitors and giving statistics on what type of people visited my website!

- (Jan 15, 2023) Personal website launch: coded with responsive website design in mind.

- (Jan 13, 2023) Coding begins. I planned my general website layout and color scheme before hand, and created three images I plan to use in the home-page in Procreate.

### ðŸ’¡: Future Ideas (after plans in documentation):
- User login functionality: See jan 16 plan. Users who take the quiz can create their own account (ability to name themselves, upload profile photos, add a bio, look up list of users)
- Game of press the button
