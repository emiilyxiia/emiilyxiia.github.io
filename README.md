# :rose: My official portfolio website in-development

This project was created in my endeavor to learn Javascript, HTML, and CSS. I hope to incorporate or learn React after this. 
My current code is in the 'developing' branch, but I will upload more polished code to main as I continue to learn.       


### Current Progress:
- [X] Navigation Bar (resizes with screen, hoverable items)
- [X] Interactive menu for screens < 960px
- [ ] Moving Portrait when hovered
- [ ] Projects / Art webpage
- [ ] Contact me button
- [ ] Streamline code
